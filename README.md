## Run Rock Paper Scissors Locally
Follow the instructions below to run the game locally in the simplest and fastest way (in my opinion):
1. Within the cloned repository, Open CMD/Terminal 
1. Execute the command `docker-compose up`. 
1. Go to localhost:3000 in your browser. 
1. Now you should have Rock Paper Scissors running.
1. To stop, execute the command `docker-compose down`
